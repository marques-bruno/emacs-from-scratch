** EXWM Configuration

We use the excellent [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] module as the basis for our Emacs Desktop Environment.  The [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] is a great place to find tips about how to configure everything!

*NOTE:* Make sure you've installed =nm-applet=, =pasystray= and =blueman= for the system tray apps to work!

* Desktop Environment

** Desktop Key Bindings

We use the [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/desktop-environment][desktop-environment]] package to automatically bind to well-known programs for controlling the volume, screen brightness, media playback, and doing other things like locking the screen and taking screenshots.  Make sure that you install the necessary programs to make this functionality work!  Check the [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/desktop-environment#default-configuration][default programs]] list to know what you need to install.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package desktop-environment
    :after exwm
    :config (desktop-environment-mode)
    :custom
    (desktop-environment-brightness-small-increment "2%+")
    (desktop-environment-brightness-small-decrement "2%-")
    (desktop-environment-brightness-normal-increment "5%+")
    (desktop-environment-brightness-normal-decrement "5%-")
    (desktop-environment-volume-toggle-command "amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle")
  )
#+end_src

** Desktop File

This file is used by your "login manager" (GDM, LightDM, etc) to display EXWM as a desktop environment option when you log in.

*IMPORTANT*: Make sure you create a symbolic link for this file into =/usr/share/xsessions=:

#+begin_src sh :tangle no

sudo ln -f ~/.emacs.d/exwm/EXWM.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/EXWM.desktop

#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :tangle ./exwm/EXWM.desktop :mkdirp yes

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=EXWM
  Comment=Emacs Window Manager
  Exec=sh /home/bruno/.emacs.d/exwm/start-exwm.sh
  TryExec=sh
  Type=Application
  X-LightDM-DesktopName=exwm
  DesktopNames=exwm

#+end_src

** Launcher Script

This launcher script is invoked by =EXWM.desktop= to start Emacs and load our desktop environment configuration.  We also start up some other helpful applications to configure the desktop experience.

#+begin_src shell :tangle ./exwm/start-exwm.sh :shebang #!/bin/sh

  # Set the screen DPI (uncomment this if needed!)
  # xrdb ~/.emacs.d/exwm/Xresources

  # Run the screen compositor
  compton &

  # Enable screen locking on suspend
  xss-lock -- slock &

  setxkb us intl

  # Fire it up
  exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs -mm --debug-init -l /home/bruno/.emacs.d/desktop.el

#+end_src

# ** Keyboard Configuration

# The =Xmodmap= file will be used with the =xmodmap= program to remap CapsLock to Ctrl inside of our desktop environment:

# #+begin_src sh :tangle ./exwm/Xmodmap

#   clear lock
#   clear control
#   keycode 66 = Control_L
#   add control = Control_L
#   add Lock = Control_R

# #+end_src

# ** DPI configuration

# The =Xresources= file will be used with =xrdb= in =start-exwm.sh= to set our screen DPI:

# #+begin_src conf :tangle ./exwm/Xresources

#   Xft.dpi:   100   # Set this to your desired DPI!  Larger number means bigger text and UI

# #+end_src

** Panel with Polybar

Polybar provides a great, minimalistic panel for your EXWM desktop configuration.  The following config integrates =emacsclient= and Polybar with =polybar-msg= to enable you to gather *any* information from Emacs and display it in the panel!

Check out the Polybar wiki for more details on how to configure it: https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Make sure the server is started (better to do this in your main Emacs config!)
  (server-start)

  (defvar efs/polybar-process nil
    "Holds the process of the running Polybar instance, if any")

  (defun efs/kill-panel ()
    (interactive)
    (when efs/polybar-process
      (ignore-errors
        (kill-process efs/polybar-process)))
    (setq efs/polybar-process nil))

  (defun efs/start-panel ()
    (interactive)
    (efs/kill-panel)
    (setq efs/polybar-process (start-process-shell-command "polybar" nil "polybar panel")))

  (defun efs/send-polybar-hook (module-name hook-index)
    (start-process-shell-command "polybar-msg" nil (format "polybar-msg hook %s %s" module-name hook-index)))

  (defun efs/send-polybar-exwm-workspace ()
    (efs/send-polybar-hook "exwm-workspace" 1))

  ;; Update panel indicator when workspace changes
  (add-hook 'exwm-workspace-switch-hook #'efs/send-polybar-exwm-workspace)

#+end_src

The configuration for our ingeniously named panel, "panel".  Invoke it with =polybar panel= on the command line!

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.config/polybar/config :mkdirp yes

** Desktop Notifications with Dunst

We use an application called [[https://dunst-project.org/][Dunst]] to enable the display of desktop notifications from Emacs and other applications running within EXWM.  Consult the [[https://dunst-project.org/documentation/][documentation]] for more details on how to configure this to your liking!

Here are some things you might want to consider changing:

- =format= - Customize how notification text contents are displayed
- =geometry= - Where the notification appears and how large it should be by default
- =urgency_normal=, etc - configures the background and frame color for notifications of different types
- =max_icon_size= - Constrain icon display since some icons will be larger than others
- =icon_path= - Important if your icons are not in a common location (like when using GNU Guix)
- =idle_threshold= - Wait for user to become active for this long before hiding notifications
- =mouse_left/right/middle_click= - Action to take when clicking a notification
- Any of the key bindings in the =shortcuts= section (though these are deprecated in 1.5.0, use =dunstctl=)

# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
# Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "category",
# "msg_urgency" and you can override the "timeout", "urgency", "foreground",
# "background", "new_icon" and "format".
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.

We can also set up some functions for enabling and disabling notifications at any time:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/disable-desktop-notifications ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process-shell-command "notify-send" nil "notify-send \"DUNST_COMMAND_PAUSE\""))

  (defun efs/enable-desktop-notifications ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process-shell-command "notify-send" nil "notify-send \"DUNST_COMMAND_RESUME\""))

  (defun efs/toggle-desktop-notifications ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process-shell-command "notify-send" nil "notify-send \"DUNST_COMMAND_TOGGLE\""))
